# Norway map - Gjensidige interview
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      This project is a Jupyter Notebook with an attempt to draw all postal codes on top of map of Norway. Objectives were the following:
      <ul>
        <li>Please draw Norway map separating each and every postal code area (could be a bit clustered in more densely populated areas)</li>
        <li>Provide the number of unique postal codes</li>
      <ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Demo:
- A working demo can be seen by opening the Notebook.ipynb in the GitHub window - https://github.com/augustinasn/_data_science_projects/blob/norway_map_gjensidige_interview/Notebook.ipynb

## Installation:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Built with:
- [Python](https://www.python.org) - Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace;
- [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) - Jupyter is a nonprofit organization created to "develop open-source software, open-standards, and services for interactive computing across dozens of programming languages". Spun off from IPython in 2014 by Fernando PÃ©rez, Project Jupyter supports execution environments in several dozen languages.
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) - In computer programming, pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series. It is free software released under the three-clause BSD license.
- [Geopandas](https://geopandas.org) - The goal of GeoPandas is to make working with geospatial data in python easier. It combines the capabilities of pandas and shapely, providing geospatial operations in pandas and a high-level interface to multiple geometries to shapely. GeoPandas enables you to easily do operations in python that would otherwise require a spatial database such as PostGIS.
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) - Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using general-purpose GUI toolkits like Tkinter, wxPython, Qt, or GTK+.
