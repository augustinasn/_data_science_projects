</table>

## Demo:
- A working demo can be seen by opening the Notebook.ipynb in the GitHub window - https://github.com/augustinasn/_data_science_projects/blob/multinomial_logistic_regression_from_scratch/Notebook.ipynb

## Installation:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Built with:
- [Python](https://www.python.org) - Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace;
- [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) - Jupyter is a nonprofit organization created to "develop open-source software, open-standards, and services for interactive computing across dozens of programming languages". Spun off from IPython in 2014 by Fernando PÃ©rez, Project Jupyter supports execution environments in several dozen languages.
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org) - NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) - In computer programming, pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series. It is free software released under the three-clause BSD license.
